# Health-Care-Project
Predicting Diabetes in Pima Indians(women)

**Health Care Analytics & Disease Prediction** 

The project has been aimed at using data science and machine learning to analyze healthcare data and make predictions of several health outcomes. It combines data preparatory, investigative and predictive analysis to give practical insights into medical practitioners. 

**Project Overview** 

The healthcare industry generates massive amounts of data. This project aims to: 

* Identify patterns in patient demographics and health history. 

* Predict specific health conditions (such as diabetes, heart disease, or chronic kidney disease) using classification algorithms. 

* Analyze the correlation between lifestyle factors and clinical outcomes. 

**Workflow** 

**1. Data Cleaning & Integration** 

Healthcare data is often "noisy." This project implements: 

* Handling of missing values using mean/median/mode imputation. 

* Detection and removal of outliers in clinical measurements (e.g., blood pressure, BMI). 

* Standardization of units and categorical feature encoding. 

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 

We perform deep dives into the data to understand distributions: 

* **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of age, gender, and clinical markers. 

* **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationship between glucose levels and disease occurrence. 

* **Correlation Mapping**: Identifying which features are the strongest predictors of health risks. 

**3. Machine Learning Modeling** 

Implementation of multiple supervised learning models: 

* **Logistic Regression**: For baseline binary classification. 

* **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting**: To handle non-linear relationships and feature importance. 

* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For high-dimensional feature spaces. 

**4. Evaluation Metrics** 

Models are evaluated not just on accuracy, but on metrics critical to healthcare: 

* **Sensitivity (Recall)**: Minimizing False Negatives (missing a sick patient). 

* **Specificity**: Minimizing False Positives (over-diagnosing). 

* **AUC-ROC Curve**: To measure the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
